## Introduction

Git is a popular and widespread version control system for text files.
Initially, it was developed by Linus Torvalds (the founder of Linux) to handle
the development of the Linux kernel code.
Nowadays, Git has become a de-facto standard among many programmers to

  * store their source code
  * use automatic versioning of their files
  * work together on the same source code
  * ...

The most popular features of Git include versioning, diffs, branching,
synchronization, and powerfull code merging capabilities.

Typically, Git is used as a command line tool, however, graphical user
interfaces (e.g. [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) for the Windows platform) exist.

### Installation (Windows)

Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and select the Windows platform.
If you have administrator rights (e.g. an 'inst-account'), you can select
the "Git for Windows Setup" version and install Git globally on the system.

If you do not have administrator rights, select the "Git for Windows Portable"
version. This allows you to install Git locally in your personal user
directory.

In any case, you probably want to choose the 64-bit version.

Download the setup.exe files and follow the instructions.

Run the newly install 'git-bash.exe' program to get a text terminal in which
use can use Git. Use the standard (Linux/Unix) commands to change directories,
view directory contents, etc.
If you are not familiar with basic Linux commands, check 
https://maker.pro/education/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners for a
comprehensive introduction.


### Basic setup

Before getting into business, you have to tell Git your identity.
This way, everyone of your committed changes can be logged with your identity
to document the actions of the development team.
To store your name and email, run

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email john.doe@basf.com
```

This needs to be done only once.


## Getting started

### Creating repositories

To get started with Git, you first need to create a repository.
You can create one locally by running

```bash
$ git init
```

in a designated directory.
This will create a (hidden) subdirectory called '.git' and the main directory
will from now on act as your Git repository.
However, if you are working with Bitbucket (a platform which hosts Git
repositories), e.g. as part of the RCN battery
research team, it is easier to create a new repository in the Bitbucket
interface and 'cloning' the repository using

```bash
$ git clone https://YOUR_USERNAME@bitbucket.basf.net/scm/PROJECT/GIT_REPO.git
```

Here, we use the https-version of the Git URL instead of the (preselected)
ssh-version.
This way, you do not have to create and handle ssh keys, but can savely interact
with Bitbucket via smartcard authentication.
Note that https is not the default setting!

## Basic functions

Basically, Git is a distributed version control system.
In contrast to other systems like CVS or SVN, you do not connect to a
central server to save your work, but check in your changes locally on your
personal filesystem.
Thus, every team member has his/her personal copy of the full repository.
The advantage of such an approach is that you can check in your work or review
older versions indepently from other team members and from the server
infrastructure.
Exchange of work, however, is typically done against a central server by syncing
your personal repository against the group repository.
Yet, the group repository is not really special, in principle you can directly
sync between team member's repositories in a peer-to-peer manner.


### add, commit, remove
Once you created (or cloned) a repository in your directory designated for your
project work, you can work with Git.
In principle, Git only knows about files which you explicitly check in to the
repository.
Any file which is not checked in (or 'added') will not be put under version
control or synced with other repositories.
Assuming you have created several files in your directory

```bash
$ ls
file1 file2 file3
```

you can check their status (i.e. whether they are checked into Git and/or have
been modified) by running

```bash
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        file1
        file2
        file3

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Here, you see that all three files are actually untracked by Git.
To add a file to version control, run

```bash
$ git add file1

```

Like most of the other commands which change the status of the repository, you
did not actually change the repository itself, but only staged the file to being
added, as you can see by again running

```bash
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   file1

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        file2
        file3
```

To actually commit your changes, run

```bash
$ git commit -m "adding the first file"
[master (root-commit) 6da0165] adding the first file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 file1

```

Use the '-m' option to add a log message to your commit.
Now, all staged changes --in this case adding 'file1'-- have been committed to
the repository.
To review all your changes, use

```bash
$ git log
commit 6da01654ade039a24ec8057a22529e7101c5e5c2 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Florian Sittel <florian.sittel@basf.com>
Date:   Fri Apr 13 12:58:14 2018 +0200

    adding the first file

```

Reviewing the current status of the repository, we realize that we forgot to
add the other two files, which we are going to do next:

```bash
$ git add file2 file3

$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   file2
        new file:   file3

$ git commit -m "add the other files"
[master 272d477] add the other files
 2 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 file2
 create mode 100644 file3

```

Now, the log shows

```bash
$ git log
commit 272d47733991162e7ed64f5b1e11275f28d81a2c (HEAD -> master)
Author: Florian Sittel <florian.sittel@basf.com>
Date:   Fri Apr 13 13:05:31 2018 +0200

    add the other files

commit 6da01654ade039a24ec8057a22529e7101c5e5c2
Author: Florian Sittel <florian.sittel@basf.com>
Date:   Fri Apr 13 12:58:14 2018 +0200

    adding the first file

```

Obviously, your log tracks all your (or your colleagues') changes of the
repository, including version number (the long hexadecimal code), auther,
timestamp, and log message.



## Working together

Typically, you will not work alone, but share your code with colleagues, either
separated by work package or time.
To this end, you will use a central server which keeps a copy of the project's
repository, in our case the Bitbucket service.
As explained before, Git is a distributed system and your repository --and thus
your commits-- are kept locally on your personal filesystem.
Thus, to exchange code and committed changes, you have to sync with the central
repository.

### Push to / pull from central server
Having set up your personal repository via cloning the original repository from
Bitbucket, syncing is particularly easy.
All information about the original server is already stored in your repository's
configuration, thus you can simply run the commands

```bash
$ git push
```

(or the following to initially set the correct branch, more about that later)

```bash
$ git push
fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

```

to push your local changes to the original (aka 'remote') repository, or

```bash
$ git pull
```

to pull the changes of others from the central repository into your personal
copy.



### Conflicts
Of course, it will happen that people work on the same files, and sometimes even
on the same parts of the source code.
In these cases, conflicts will emerge which Git sometimes is able to manage
automatically, sometimes, however, it is necessary to tell Git what to do.

Imagine somebody else checked out the above repository and changed the content
of file1, which was empty before.

At the same time, you have yourself begun to write some text in file1, which
is different from what your colleague has written.
Both of you committed your changes to your local repositories, your colleague,
however was faster than you in pushing his changes to the central server.
When you now run

```bash
$ git commit -am "created content for file1"
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in file1.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.
[master 56450ef] created content for file1
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)


$ git push --set-upstream origin master
To C:/Users/sittelf/devel/git_test_bare
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'C:/Users/sittelf/devel/git_test_bare'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

```

You get an error message that your changes have been rejected by the central
repository ('remote').



### Branches, Merging
